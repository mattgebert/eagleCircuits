Custom Designed Circuits constructed in Eagle for various purposes.

## 1. [Differential Amplifier x2](https://github.com/mattgebert/eagleCircuits/tree/master/BEC%20FPGA-ADC%20Differential%20Amplifier)
A two unit differential amplifier designed to run for the ADA4807-2 Module.
Used in a BEC lab to step down a ADC signal centred around 1V (0V to 2V) down 
to a 0V bias (-5V to 5V).
