# eagleCircuits
Custom Designed Circuits constructed in Eagle for various purposes.

## 1. [Differential Amplifier x2](https://github.com/mattgebert/eagleCircuits/tree/master/BEC%20FPGA-ADC%20Differential%20Amplifier)
A two unit differential amplifier designed to run for the ADA4807-2 Module.
Used in a BEC lab to step down a ADC signal centred around 1V (0V to 2V) down 
to a 0V bias (-5V to 5V). 

## 2. [Probe Station Board](https://github.com/mattgebert/eagleCircuits/tree/master/ProbeStationBoard)
A general board to load 1cm x 1cm electronic samples on. Provides pads to create electrical connections without damaging sample.
Provides 10x unconnected pads (3.18mm^2). Also provides 1x sample pad (7.8mm^2) & 2x gate pads (4.13mm^2) connected, to load the substrate base and connect probes to respectively.
